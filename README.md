## Structure & Usage

The curriculum is spit into 4 main parts, called stages. Every stage builds into the next and the sequence is meant to be followed strictly.

Each stage is hands-on, and is designed to empower engineers to demonstrate specific technical and professional expertise through engagements, projects, coaching, and feedback.

> The engagements and projects are broken down into technical and professional skills outputs, which can be submitted by the enginners or observed from them. The outputs are then scored to determine how aligned an engineer is to the desired expectation

## Program Structure

1.  [Stage - 1 : Foundation](./foundation.md)
2.  [Stage - 2 : Language Specialization](./lang-specialization.md)
3.  Stage - 3 : Stack Specialization
